Over the last week I’ve been working on a new [website](http://www.nload.io) based on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Learning GitHub Pages was easy and I found the whole concept very useful for creating static websites and I took the opportunity to build a new personal website.

The new website features a blog section where I will be able to write articles about Software Development and Architecture and keep friends and clients up to date with any news in my little dev empire.

The site is powered by Jekyll and I’ve developed a custom theme to suit my needs.



Please let me know what you think. 

Your comments, suggestions and complaints will help me shape the further evolution and improvement of the website.
