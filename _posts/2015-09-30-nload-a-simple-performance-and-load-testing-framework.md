Over the last few months I've been working on a new open-source project called [NLoad](http://www.nload.io/).

NLoad is a simple performance and load testing framework for .NET mainly used for testing Websites, WCF Services and small bits of code to identify and eliminate bottlenecks at an early stage of development.

The main goal of NLoad is to provide a quick way to generate load using multiple threads on a single machine.

For further information and instructions on using NLoad in your projects please visit [NLoad Website](http://www.nload.io/).
