I've recently published a new Visual Studio extension called AnyStatus. Progress is going well, so I'd like to share some details, and get your feedback.

## What is it?

AnyStatus extension adds basic monitoring capabilities to Visual Studio.

With AnyStatus you can monitor HTTP servers, send Ping requests, check TCP ports, monitor GitHub Issues, monitor CI builds on Team Foundation Server, Jenkins, TeamCity, AppVeyor...and much more. All from within Visual Studio.

## Why?

AnyStatus provides a quick view of the status of services and resources.

## How?

AnyStatus extensions adds a Tool Window in Visual Studio that shows status items in a folder hierarchy.
